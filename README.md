# 3D Rendering - Illumination and Shading
## Description
For this project, me and my partner Jonny DeMarais created fragment and vertex shaders for both Phong and Gouraud lighting algorithms. We also made three different scenes to demonstrate these shaders. To do all this, we used WebGL and Babylon JS to apply the lighting calculations and math that was taught during class. We learned how the Babylon library works and how to make different 3D objects from it along with applying different textures and lighting properties like specular and reflectiveness. We also learned how to add lights to the scene of different colors and intensities.

<h3> About </h3>

This project contains three 3 dimensional interactive scenes. At the top of the page you will have the option to change the scene, 
the shading algorithm, heightmap scale, and primary light source. You can use the arrow keys to move around and wasdrf to change the 
the position of the light.
